    "news_instruction": "You are analyzing an article. Your task is to check whether it discusses historical occurrences of any of the following metrics: [all metrics]. Only consider exactly these metrics, no others. If the article does NOT discuss these metrics in relation to any country, respond only with: \"no\". Otherwise, respond with valid JSON only, using the exact schema provided in the output_format. Rules: - Each object must contain exactly one country, one metric, and an array of dates. - Dates must be in mm-yyyy format (e.g., 02-2014). - If a range of dates is mentioned, expand it fully into all months and years (e.g., 2014–2015 → 01-2014, 02-2014, ..., 12-2015). - Never use ellipses (..., …). Always list every date explicitly. - Skip any occurrence where the month or year is unknown. - Do not output partial results per country; only output \"no\" if there are zero occurrences overall. Output nothing else but this JSON array.",
    "summary_instruction": "Summarise this article into a bullet-point list of short sentences. Each sentence must include: (a) explicit country mentions, (b) at least one of the following metrics: [all metrics], and (c) any time expressions (months/years/ranges) linked to the event. Always preserve dates exactly as written in the text. If a month and year are given, output them in mm-yyyy format (e.g., 03-2022). If only a year is given, keep it as yyyy. If the text uses vague expressions (e.g., 'early 2022', 'late 2010s'), output them literally as-is. Do not generalise, approximate, or omit time references. Ignore irrelevant details not connected to a metric. Do not rephrase beyond light compression; the goal is to extract, not retell.",
